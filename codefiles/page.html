        Daisy Bacon (1898â€“1986) was an American pulp fiction magazine editor and writer, best known as the editor of Love Story Magazine from 1928 to 1947. She was hired in 1926 to assist with "Friends in Need", an advice column in the magazine, by Street & Smith, a major pulp magazine publisher. Two years later she was promoted to editor. Love Story was one of the most successful pulp magazines, and Bacon was frequently interviewed about her role and her opinions of modern romance. Street & Smith gave Bacon other magazines to edit, including Ainslee's in the mid-1930s and Pocket Love in the late 1930s. From 1940 to 1947 she took over as editor of Romantic Range, which featured love stories set in the American West, and in 1941 she was also given the editorship of Detective Story.

        <div id="second">Pinot gris, or pinot grigio, is a grape variety of the species Vitis vinifera used to make white wine. Thought to be a mutant clone of pinot noir, it normally has a pinkish-gray hue, accounting for its name, but the colors can vary from blue-gray to pinkish-brown. Pinot gris thrives in cooler climates, with the major growing regions being Alsace in France, northeastern Italy and the U.S. state of Oregon. The wines vary greatly with these regions; for example, Alsatian pinot gris wines are medium to full-bodied and tend to be spicy in comparison with others. This photograph of a bunch of pinot gris grapes was focus-stacked from twelve separate frames.
